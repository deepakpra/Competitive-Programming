 build.sh https://pastebin.com/xhw4rLfn
 - Format: build.sh A
 - Compiles A.cpp into output file A
 
 -ex: build.sh Sol && build.sh brute && build.sh gen

- stress.sh https://pastebin.com/MkfwM3S9
 - Format: stress.sh solutionA solutionB generator numTests
 - Runs solutionA and solutionB against test cases output by generator 
   and outputs a test on which they give different results

-ex: stress.sh sol brute gen 10
   
- validate.sh https://pastebin.com/zuRze3aW
 - Format: validate.sh solution validator generator numTests
 - Runs solution against test cases output by generator, then feeds 
   the test cases followed by the output into validator.  
   Returns a test case on which the validator does not output "OK".

Windows: stress.bat

You have to prepare 3 other programs along with this script. 
Those are, your original solution (sol.cpp), 
the bruteforce/correct solution (brute.cpp), 
and the randomized input generator (gen.cpp).

Have them all in the same directory.


Do one of the following depending on your needs:

Compile the 3 programs and stress test the solution on 100 randomized test cases:
 stress

Compile the 3 programs and stress test the solution on n randomized test cases:
 stress [n]
 ex: stress 10
 
Stress test the solution on n randomized test cases without compiling the 3 programs:
 stress [n] 0
